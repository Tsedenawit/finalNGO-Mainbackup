                    In Ethiopia, the illiteracy rate is over 60% and girls attend school on average only about half as long as boys. Traditional social role models and a lack of financial resources mean that girls and young women from socially disadvantaged backgrounds in particular are denied the chance of further education. As a result, the everyday life of many women in Addis Ababa is characterised by poverty and dependence on the family.

In order to break out of this spiral, our partner organisation PROJECT-E in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, offers young disadvantaged women a chance of vocational training and thus enables them to lead a better life. In the PROJECT-E Hospitality Institute young women are trained in the field of hotel management (“Hotel Operations”). PROJECT-E also offers a four-month short-term training course with accredited training in housekeeping. This enables the graduates to start their professional life and provides them with the basis for further training and a qualification that leads to a higher income.
